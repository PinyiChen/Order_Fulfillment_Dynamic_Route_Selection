## Instruction for running the simulations

1. Set up input parameters in config.yaml, or overwrite it in playround.ipynb. The defaulted yaml file runs only the QP algorithm, but other algorithms are coded as well. User can run multiple algorithms on the test case by setting the algorithm parameters to ``True" in yaml file. 

2. Create test cases in the data file. data/Case_X is an example, which contains all the required input files. 

3. Use playround.ipynb to do test runs.

4. Example of outputs are stored in the output file.
